# Notes frontend

This repository contains the frontend developed from part 2 onwards in the Full Stack course. 

Notes frontend is a simple web application for saving notes. It is developed using React and Vite. 

From part 3 of the course onwards, it is intended to be used with a separate backend, which is available in the repository (TBD https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part3-notes-backend).

## Running the application on your own machine

Follow these steps to run the application:

Clone this repository to your own machine with the command git `clone https://github.com/irfanalkan23/notes.git`

Navigate to the cloned repository with the command `cd notes`

Switch to the desired branch with the command `git switch <branch-name>`

Install the node modules with the command `npm install`

Start the application with the command `npm run dev`. By default, the application will start on port 5173, so it will be available at http://localhost:5173/

If you are in branches part2-4 to part2-8, additionally start the JSON server by running the command `npm run server` in a separate terminal window.

From part 3 onwards, the frontend is used with a separate backend.
